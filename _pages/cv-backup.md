Education
======
* Ph.D in Environmental Engineering, University of Washington, 2023
* B.E. in Environmental Engineering, Tsinghua University, 2017
* B.A. in Business Administration, Tsinghua University, 2017
* Exchange student in Globalization Program, Venice International University, 2016

Research experience
======
* Assistant Professor, Aug 2025 - Present
  * Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Texas A&M University   
* Postdoctoral Scholar, Jul 2023 - Jul 2025
  * Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley
    * Developed a data-driven high-resolution (1 km) and computational-efficient air quality modeling, based on 200 TB raw data, to connect emissions to ambient air pollution concentrations (digital twin). 
    * Implemented the distributed computing of air quality models using Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform.
    * Developed an optimization approach for monitoring site siting, utilizing remote sensing data and observational data.
 
* Doctoral Research Fellow, Aug 2017 - Jun 2023
  * Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington
    * Developed a data-driven algorithm, based on machine learning modeling and geospatial optimization, to quantify the spatial origins of ambient air pollution for every census block (n = 6 million) in the US.
    * Led an interdisciplinary team to utilize multiple statistical approaches to investigate the relationship between air pollution and socioeconomic status in China, involving unstructured qualitative and quantitative data.
    * Led a cross-institutional research team to develop a stepwise optimization approach for emission interventions to achieve the largest environmental, social justice, and health benefits. 


* Research Assistant, Jul 2016 - Sep 2016
  * Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, University of California, Los Angeles
    * Analyzed the relationship between retail development from 1990 and 2010 and tract-level socioeconomic status. The work was involved in the publication <em>South Los Angeles Since the 1960s: Race, Place, and Class.</em>

* Research Assistant, Oct 2015 - Jul 2017
  * Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University 
    * Built an hourly-based semi-empirical PM2.5 forecast statistical model based on backward trajectory, background concentration and meteorological data in three megacities in China

* Research Assistant, Jun 2015 - Aug 2015
  * Policy Research Center for Environment and Economy, Ministry of Environmental Protection, P. R. China
    * Assisted to evaluate the implement of <em>Air Pollutant Emission Standards for Flat Glass Industry (GB26453-2011).</em>
    * Composed a research report <em>PPP Financing Model in the Field of Environmental Protection in China.</em>
