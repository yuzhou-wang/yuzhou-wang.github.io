Alan Gonzalez joined the Air Intelligence Lab as a Ph.D. student.

Alan's research focuses on developing modeling methods to assess past and future climate. 
Historically, cloud formation processes have served as one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in climate assessments. 
Models can be used to evaluate the influence of meteorological and emission drivers on aerosol composition, along with their respective cloud formation properties. 
Within the scientific community, future climate scenarios are used to convey varying levels of social, economic, and environmental development. 
To model future air quality at community scales, the meteorology and emissions from these scenarios require the implementation of additional spatial and temporal downscaling. 
Based on the modeled concentrations of air pollutants, impact assessments can then be used to explore potential climate-related disparities or inequalities that may arise depending on the level of collective consensus on mitigation initiatives.

Alan has strong expertise in emissions downscaling, chemical transport model simulation, and integrated risk assessment.
