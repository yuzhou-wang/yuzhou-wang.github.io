**Addressing U.S. Racial-Ethnic Inequality in Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>**

The Clean Air Act has dramatically reduced outdoor air pollution levels in the US over the past decades, yet national racial-ethnic exposure disparities persist. People of color are exposed to higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. It is unknown how to systematically eliminate these disparities. Using InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution) source-receptor matrix (ISRM), we investigate three emission-reduction approaches, and compare their optimal ability to address the disparity. Our results suggest that two main current regulatory strategies (targeting specific economic sectors, requiring urban regions to meet concentration standards) are ineffective at addressing national average racial-ethnic inequalities. In contrast, those inequalities can be eliminated with modest emission-reduction using a location-specific approach (optimal: ~1% of total emissions). That approach is not included in current national regulatory frameworks (but it is being discussed, and some states have implemented it); also, that approach does as well as or better than the two other approaches, at the goal of reducing overall population average. This research informs the active national conversation about addressing environmental injustice, by providing a scientifically grounded approach for eliminating disparities.
