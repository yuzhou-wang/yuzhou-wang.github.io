<figcaption align="left"><b>PM2.5 exposure disparity reduction curves.</b> Current conditions are the left side (i.e., "do nothing" at x=0) and a complete (100%) emission-reduction is the right side (i.e., achieving zero emissions: lower-right, at x=30.4 MT/y). The plot compares three approaches to emission-reduction: "location" (green line), "sector" (blue line), and "NAAQS-like" ( i.e., employing a concentration standard, here 6 $\mathrm{\mu g/m^{3}}$; orange line). An "equal reduction" approach, where all emissions are reduced proportionately, would be a straight line (black dotted line). The "location" approach (green line) can eliminate national disparities with modest total emission reductions, whereas with the other two approaches, national disparities remain even after substantial emission reductions)</figcaption>

The Clean Air Act has dramatically reduced outdoor air pollution levels in the US over the past decades, yet national racial-ethnic exposure disparities persist. People of color are exposed to higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. It is unknown how to systematically eliminate these disparities. Using InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution) source-receptor matrix (ISRM), we investigate three emission-reduction approaches, and compare their optimal ability to address the disparity. Results suggest that two main current regulatory strategies are ineffective at addressing national average racial-ethnic inequalities. In contrast, those inequalities can be eliminated with modest emission-reduction (optimal: ~1% of total emissions) using a location-specific approach. That approach is not included in current national regulatory frameworks (but it is being discussed, and some states have implemented it); also, that approach does as well as or better than the two other approaches, at the goal of reducing overall population average. This research informs the active national conversation about addressing environmental injustice, by providing a scientifically grounded approach for eliminating disparities.

Air pollution disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) display an inverse relationship (i.e., higher concentrations for lower-SES populations) in US and many high-income countries. In contrast, my study in China (a country accounting for 26% of global premature deaths from ambient air pollution) indicate a reverse pattern. Combing air pollution data from a national empirical model and demographic data from (1) national gridded GDP per capita, and (2) a national representative sample of 21,095 individuals from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we quantify air pollution disparities among individual’s rural-to-urban migration status; SES factors (education, occupation, and income); and minority status. Results indicate that in China, ambient NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are higher for high-SES than for low-SES individuals. The findings imply that in China’s current industrialization and urbanization stage, economic development is correlated with both SES and air pollution.
