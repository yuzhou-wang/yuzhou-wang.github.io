I'm a final-year Ph.D. student at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Washington. My advisor is Dr. [Julian Marshall](https://depts.washington.edu/airqual/). I received a Bechelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a second Bechelor's degree in Busniss Administration from Tsinghua University in 2017. 

My research interest is in air pollution exposure assessment, including: </br>
(1) sources and spatial patterns of ambient air pollution that people breathe; </br>
(2) Environmental Justice: how those exposures correlate with race and socioeconomic status; </br>
(3) Environmental Policy: how to reduce those exposures and exposure inequalities. 

I have experience in machine learning, statistics, and geospatial data analysis. I also have strong experience in developing reduced complexity air quality model.
