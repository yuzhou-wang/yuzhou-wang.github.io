I'm an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University, Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. 

My research interests include: 
(1) Air Quality Modeling;
(2) Air Pollution Exposure;
(3) Machine Learning;
(4) Environmental Policy. 
My primary research objective is to develop data-driven models and evidence-based policy solutions for addressing environmental, climate, and health impacts from emission activities.

I did my postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley. I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Washington in 2023. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a second Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Tsinghua University in 2017.
