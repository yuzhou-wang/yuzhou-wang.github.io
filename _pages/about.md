I'm a postdoc at University of California, Berkeley, working with Dr. [Joshua Apte] (https://apte.berkeley.edu/). I recieved my PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from University of Washington in 2023. My PhD advisor is Dr. [Julian Marshall](https://depts.washington.edu/airqual/). I received a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a second Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Tsinghua University in 2017. 

My research interest is in air pollution exposure assessment, including: 

(1) sources and spatial patterns of ambient air pollution that people breathe, using both empirical and source-receptor models; 

(2) Environmental Justice: how those exposures correlate with race and socioeconomic status; 

(3) Environmental Policy: how to reduce those exposures and exposure inequalities. 

I have experience in statistical machine learning, biostatistics, and geospatial data analysis. I also have strong experience in developing reduced complexity air quality model.
