I'm an incoming Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University, Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, starting on August 1, 2025. I'm currently a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Dr. [Joshua Apte](https://apte.berkeley.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the University of Washington in 2023, working with Dr. [Julian Marshall](https://depts.washington.edu/airqual/). I earned a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering and a second Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Tsinghua University in 2017. 

My research interests include: 
(1) Air Quality Modeling;
(2) Air Pollution Exposure;
(3) Machine Learning;
(4) Environmental Policy. 
My primary research objective is to develop data-driven models and evidence-based policy solutions for addressing environmental, climate, and health impacts from emission activities.
